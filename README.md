## Why This Data?
I chose this dataset because it shows Disneyâ€™s **entire box office history**, making it perfect for exploring how big acquisitions shaped financial success.  

As a lifelong Disney fan, I was especially interested in how buying **Pixar (2006)**, **Marvel (2009)**, and **Lucasfilm (2012)** changed Disneyâ€™s revenue trajectory.
