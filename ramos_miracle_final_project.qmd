### **Overview**
This dataset, `disney_boxoffice_history.csv`, tracks **Disney’s box office performance**, focusing on **revenue trends, acquisitions, and genre profitability**.
<br>
<br>

### **Why This Data?**
I chose this dataset because it shows Disney's full box office history, making it great for exploring how its big acquisitions impacted success. I also love Disney, so this topic is really interesting to me. I’m especially interested in seeing how buying **Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), and Lucasfilm (2012)** changed Disney’s box office performance over time.

## **Conclusion**

- **Disney’s acquisitions (Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm) significantly boosted revenue**, with each studio contributing billions in box office earnings.

- **Superhero and animated films dominate Disney’s financial success**, proving to be the most consistently profitable genres.

- **The post 2010 box office landscape is increasingly
concentrated**, with Disney’s highest grossing films generating a larger share of total revenue.

- **Each acquisition was a strong investment**, as the total revenue from Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm films post acquisition has continued to grow. While the available data up to 2016 showed these studios approaching their acquisition cost, the release of additional films since then has pushed their total box office earnings beyond the initial investment.
